  Neovim API is more powerful than Vim API. But this comes at the price of:

  - redundance: there are lots of ways to do similar (or even the same) thing,
    and many of the new ways aren't better than the old ones. Sometimes new
    functions appear, that try to remedy deficiencies of older functions, and
    this can happen repeatedly (|nvim_command|, |nvim_exec|, |nvim_cmd|...).
    This is somewhat expected since it's not even reached version 1, but
    currently it's a problem.

  - user unfriendliness: vim API mostly supports optional parameters. Neovim
    API doesn't, for its own reasons. I'm not arguing with the thought that
    the C API must be strict. But Lua API could be different...
    Instead it is not. You can't call |vim.api| functions without providing
    all optional arguments (even if they're just placeholders, 'reserved for
    future use'). And even lua-only functions like |vim.split()| aren't more
    merciful.



USAGE                                                         *nvim-lib-usage*
==============================================================================

  It's not recommended to load all modules at startup, that is in your
  vimrc, since loading them has a cost.

  The library is split in several components, to reduce this cost.

  If you need more modules in a script, you can do for convenience:
>lua
    local api, nvim, tbl, arr = require("nvim-lib")()
<
  You require individual modules with:
>lua
    local api = require("nvim-lib").api
    local nvim = require("nvim-lib").nvim
    local tbl = require("nvim-lib").tbl
    local arr = require("nvim-lib").arr
<
                                                                *nvim-lib-log*
  Some errors are not raised, they added to an internal log.
  To show the log: >
    require("nvim-lib.util").log()



MODULE - API                                                    *nvim-lib-api*
==============================================================================

  With this module you can call API functions like this:
>lua
    api.win_close(...) -- instead of vim.api.nvim_win_close(...)
<
  There are no other differences, nor any performance impact. Names are still
  perfectly searchable with `K` key (unless it is replaced by `lsp`, for
  example).

  They are just links to the original functions, so extra arguments for these
  functions are NOT optional.



MODULE - NVIM                                                  *nvim-lib-nvim*

  Extra arguments for these functions are generally optional.

  This module also includes some tables for better accessibility of several
  functionalities (registers, marks, keycodes). |nvim-lib-extras|



WORKING WITH TABLES                                          |nvim-lib-tables|
==============================================================================

  Neovim 0.10 has a |vim.iter| module, that has more functionalities, but is
  2x slower in my tests.

  In Lua, handling tables is slightly complicated by the fact that a table can
  be at the same time associative (keys are string) and array-like (with
  numerical indices), so they can behave like both.

  Note: when describing the modules, I'll talk about:

  • `table`     can be anything
  • `array`     part of a table with numerical indices, can contain holes
  • `sequence`  part of a table that can be iterated with |ipairs|

  There are two submodules that handle tables:

    • `tbl`     handles all kinds of tables               |nvim-lib-tbl.txt|
    • `arr`     specializes in arrays and sequences       |nvim-lib-arr.txt|

  |require| with:
>lua
    local tbl = require("nvim-lib").tbl
    local arr = require("nvim-lib").arr
<
  Differently from |vim.tbl_|* functions, they can change the table in-place,
  and {fn} is called with `(key, value)`, not only with `(value)`.
  Also, they never do table validation. You're responsible for that.

  Some functions have an `iter` parameter, meaning they accept an iterator
  function, default is |pairs|.

  Metatables ~

  When a function returns a table, and one or more tables were passed as
  arguments, and the returning table is newly created, it inherits the
  metatable of the first table passed as argument.

  This allows, among other things, to use the provided functions as `methods`,
  if you `call` the modules with a table:
  >lua
    local arr = require("nvim-lib").arr

    -- `array` will then be able to use `arr` functions as methods
    local array = arr({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})

    vim.print(array
      :map(function(k, v) return v + 1 end)     -- { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
      :slice(2, 4)                              -- { 3, 4, 5 }
      :map(function(k, v) return v .. '*' end)  -- { '3*', '4*', '5*' }
    )

NOTES ABOUT VIM.TBL_* FUNCTIONS                              *nvim-lib-vimtbl*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Can be found at (|gf| over path): `$VIMRUNTIME/lua/vim/shared.lua`

  WARNING: polemic tones ahead!

  Forgive me for my impudence, but I think the |vim.tbl_|* stuff is bad.
  Many of those functions do some sort of table validation: maybe it's needed
  for |vim.lsp| but I doubt anybody else needs it this bad.
  In some cases at least, this validation makes also mandatory parameters that
  could be optional, eg. |vim.split()|, |vim.tbl_extend()|.
  Some functions are intended to work only with arrays, and it's not always
  documented. An example below.

  |vim.tbl_filter()| behaves differently from what one could understand
  from reading the documentation:
  - it creates a new table
  - it assumes {table} is an array
  - it will actually CHANGE an associative table to an array with the
    filtered values (in the copy of course), so that information about keys is
    lost!

  So it's not simply a filtering function, it's something different.
  It has its uses: it just isn't what you'd expect it to be. And what it
  actually is, isn't documented. And if you don't know what it is, it could
  screw up your tables with you wondering why it's happening.

  |vim.tbl_isempty()| just checks `next(t) == nil`, as it should, but it does
  table validation. Totally useless. Spare yourself a table lookup, a function
  call, an underscore AND a damn table validation, and type also less
  characters (13 vs. 17, both bring bad luck unfortunately).
  To be honest, I included a |tbl.empty| function as well.

  In these modules you find variants of all those functions that don't do any
  table validation, and are a bit faster when possible.
  Of course you can check them and if you find mistake please file an issue.
